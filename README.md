# Who we are
-----
We are a group of students at the University of Delaware completing an undergraduate degree in computer science. One opportunity provided by this degree is a senior capstone course in software design. In this class, students are given the chance to work in teams to develop an application of a modern software engineering process for a client. This year, we were given the opportunity to work alongside computer scientist Andrew Nocovin, a professor at the University of Delaware. Professor Novocin works in applications of algebraic number theory, pedagogical practices, and software engineering. In addition, he has spent considerable effort creating high-performance open-source implementations of his algorithms for use by daily practitioners. With his guidance and extensive knowledge of Minecraft, we worked on developing an application to download Minecraft builds into individual worlds. With this, you can import your favorite online Minecraft creations onto your own world.

# How this works
-----
This application consists of three main components: a database, a website, and a Minecraft Discord bot. To provide this product, each of these components performs a separate job while working in a union. To learn more about each component and the computer science behind this application, please visit [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nJhoP-JbsBBBqY6H7pMFPCYHvQ1CVHDsdWiyjupvC34/).
