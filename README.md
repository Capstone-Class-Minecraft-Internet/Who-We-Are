# Who we are
-----
We are a group of students at the [University of Delaware](https://www.cis.udel.edu/) completing an undergraduate degree in computer science. One opportunity provided by this degree is a senior capstone course in software design. In this class, students are given the chance to work in teams to develop an application of a modern software engineering process for a client. This year, we were given the opportunity to work alongside computer scientist [Andrew Nocovin](https://www.ece.udel.edu/people/faculty/andynovo/), a professor at the University of Delaware. Professor Novocin works in applications of algebraic number theory, pedagogical practices, and software engineering. In addition, he has spent considerable effort creating high-performance open-source implementations of his algorithms for use by daily practitioners. With his guidance and extensive knowledge of Minecraft, we worked on developing an application to download Minecraft builds into individual worlds. With this, you can import your favorite online Minecraft creations onto your own world.

# How this works
-----
This application consists of three main components: a database, a website, and a Minecraft Discord bot. To provide this product, each of these components performs a separate job while working in a union. To learn more about each component and the computer science behind this application, please visit [Educational/Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qs5xLDO0QNNljG4JbwsDyfQLw6ti465QDh5wwUJI0MA/edit). To learn more about Andrew Novocin, please see [prof.ninja](https://prof.ninja/). Here is [visual representation of our work](https://github.com/Capstone-Class-Minecraft-Internet/visual-representation-of-our-work).

# Our future
-----
Our goal is to partner with your favorite Minecraft builders to bring their creations into your own. Well-known Minecraft players invest countless hours in creating structures that they then publish publicly through sites like Youtube. Many of these structures are beyond the capabilities of the typical Minecraft builder, but this is what we aim to change. Through this partnership, we hope to share these creative builds with other players who have a similar passion for the game. In addition, we hope our clients and fellow Minecraft lovers will develop an interest in computer science through this application. Our educational documentation was created as a way to simplify the behind-the-scenes computer science systems that this application is composed of.

# Inspiration
-----
Watching some of our favorite Minecraft builders create structures is what inspired us to create this application. Feel free to check out some of our favorite Minecraft builders and most viewed creations.
